# OIII_flux_scaling
This code corrects the flux value of the [OIII] 5007 Angstrom line and aligns the center of the line profile with respect to the reference spectrum.

This code will be updated soon with:
1. Better methodology of continuum subtraction and interpolation.
2. Multiprocessing of the GW-MCMC to make it faster.
3. Options to include a convolution function other than Gaussian.
